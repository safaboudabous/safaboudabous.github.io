Before joining [CEREMADE](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr), I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Orange Innovation](https://fr.linkedin.com/company/orange), a leading French telecommunication company. I was part of the BRAIN team and worked with Dr [Alexis Bondu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-bondu-5a667a2) and Dr [Yassine Nair-BenRekia](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/yassine-nair-benrekia-2884ba6a) on cross-learning across heterogeneous seasonal time series for roaming traffic demand forecasting.

I received my PhD in Machine Learning in 2021 from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr) ([Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)), under the supervision of professors [Houda Labiod](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/houda-labiod-0a408511) and [Stephan Clémençon](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/clemenco/). My PhD was financed by [VEDECOM](https://fr.linkedin.com/company/vedecom), the French Research and Training Institute dedicated to sustainable mobility, where I contributed to the SYNTONIE project led by Dr [Julian Garbiso](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/julian-garbiso/fr) (formerly by Dr [Bertrand Leroy](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=CuJVeUsAAAAJ)).

Before this, I obtained a master's in data science at [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr) in 2017. In 2015, I graduated from the Tunisian [National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology](https://insat.rnu.tn) with a major in software engineering and Big Data management.
